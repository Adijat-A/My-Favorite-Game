<p> Geometry dash is a rhythm game made by Robert Topala (RobTop) in 2013, over the following years, there have been a variety of updates with the most recent one being update 2.1! The GD community have been waiting for update 2.2 for about six years but in October of this year, update 2.2 will be released which has made alot of GD players excited for the following update such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JuniperGD" target="_blank">Juniper</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EricVanWilderman" target="_blank">EVW</a> and many more!</p>

<h2><u> Achievements </h2></u>
<img class="img_deg" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.JHEUQZctgFq46tLt1r_gyQHaEK?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
<p> Throughout the game there are about 266 achievements which can be rewarded by doing certain things, some being harder than others with the hardest one being to make a level good enough for <a href="https://geometrydashmoderators.jimdofree.com/home/gd-moderators-list/#:~:text=Geometry%20Dash%20Moderators%20List%201%20Agdor%20%20,loserchik67%20%20%20%20%20%20More%20items" target="_blank"> GD Moderators </a> to send them to RobTop and give a star rating. Due to there being so many updates, it's been harder to create a feature-worthy level as standards increase nearly every update.
<br>
You can find the Geometry Dash achievements <a href="https://geometry-dash.fandom.com/wiki/Achievements" target="_blank"> here </a>.

<h2><u> Creating </h2></u>
<img class="img_deg" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dzeKBfvwEL0/maxresdefault.jpg">
<p> Geometry Dash is a never-ending game due to the fact that you can create level that may or may not get a star rating. Because RobTop added a GD editor more and more levels have been added to the GD servers, some better than others. Having the dedication to create a wonderful masterpiece is a skill in itself as it can be very tiring to create such a high detail level such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alafxkFTprU" target="_blank"> this one </a>.
    Although some levels are amazing, there is a limit towards how many objects you can put in a level so anyone on any device can play their levels with no problems but there's a bypass which allows you to go beyond the limit thus having a high object count (which is over 40k objects).
<br><br>
<h2> Demons </h2>
<img class="img_deg" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iyFTVfXXDW8/maxresdefault.jpg">
<p> Demons are the hardest difficulty in the game. In the early days of Geometry Dash, everyone was on mobile which gave them a disadvantage making them nearly impossible to complete. At the time, it was easy for hackers to mess up the games servers as the game had a lot of insecurities and most demons got hacked for random purposes causing alot of distress in the GD community. A few updates later, Geometry Dash was added to PC and RobTop made the servers more secure so hackers can't cause anymore havoc among the servers and it was easier to slay demons as you could modify the FPS (Frames Per Second) which is allowed as some people may have lower end monitors.

<h2> Top GD Players </h2>
<img class="img_deg" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NtzRHoz5Ts/maxresdefault.jpg">
<p> Nearly every GD player plays on PC because it's easier to beat demons but some players stand out as there are able to complete extreme demons constantly; because of all the demon grinding, <br><a href="https://www.pointercrate.com/demonlist/" target="_blank"> the demonlist </a> was created ranking some of the hardest levels by difficulty. Every demon you beat, you get a certian amount of demonlist points (if somebody had beaten Acheron, the'd get a ton of demonlist points because of how hard it is). Some of the best players spent countless hours practising these levels so they can complete them some of the players being: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zoink/videos"> Zoink </a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@doggiedasher/videos"> Doggie </a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@npesta/videos"> Npesta </a> and many more!
